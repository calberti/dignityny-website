Our priority is the safety of our members and guests, especially those who rely on public transportation or must travel after dark.</p>\n<p>Liturgy will begin at our usual time of 6:30 PM Eastern. The Zoom link and worship aid will be sent as usual.</p>\n<p>Please help us spread the word by contacting anyone who may not regularly check email or social media. We want to ensure that no one travels unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your flexibility and care for one another. We look forward to gathering together virtually.</p>\n<p>In community,</p>\n<p>[Name]<br/>\nDignity/New York Steering Committee</p>",

    "date": "",
    "body": "<p>November 2025</p>\n<p>Dear Members and Friends of Dignity/New York,</p>\n<p>As Advent approaches, we look back on another eventful year in the life of our community.  Our inspiring Sunday liturgies, both in person and online, our socials at St. John’s, and our Zoom chats anchor us in weekly worship and support.  Our many other celebrations, informal dinners, theater outings, Pride activities, and social media presence deepen our connections to one another.  Our commitment to equality and inclusion for people of all sexual orientations and genders in the Catholic Church and society is just as strong as ever.</p>\n<p>In these difficult times, particularly for the LGBTQIA+ community, we are especially mindful of the Advent promise of justice.  For 53 years, we have been working for justice through countless acts of witness in the streets, in the courts, and through the media. Through our leaders in DignityUSA, our message has now been heard at the highest levels of our church, at the recent Vatican Synod and in a personal meeting with the late Pope Francis.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, we could not do all of this without your generous financial support. As you can see from the financial report below, our weekly collections do not cover the full cost of our programs and activities.  Moreover, we depend on the Advent Appeal to make up a substantial part of the difference.  To contribute, please see the contribution form below, or go to our website, <a href=\"http://www.dignitny.org.&amp;nbsp\">www.dignitny.org.&amp;nbsp</a>; You can now contribute by using Zelle, a credit card, a check, or through online banking.</p>\n<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to social justice, we will continue our tradition of contributing 10% of our Advent Appeal to the Trinity Place Shelter for LGBTQIA+ youth on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. This outstanding organization provides transitional housing and supportive services for up to 18 months for 10 young homeless adults at a time.</p>\n<p>To help enrich our experience of Advent, we will be offering digital prayer resources that can be accessed through our website.  We also invite you to join DignityUSA’s weekly online Advent Reflection Series, starting on December 3. Visit <a href=\"http://www.dignityusa.org\">www.dignityusa.org</a> to register.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you at St. John’s or online for our Christmas Eve liturgy on Wednesday, December 24, at 6:30 PM Eastern.  Our regular weekly liturgies will be held every Sunday in December at 6:30 PM Eastern. There will be no liturgy on New Year’s Eve.</p>\n<p>With our warmest wishes for a peaceful and joyful Advent and Christmas, and a holy and healthy New Year,</p>\n<p><i>The Steering Committee of Dignity/New York</i></p>\n<p><i>Chris Alberti, Robert Brande, Nicholas Cimato, Danny Larkin, James Osbourn, Lewis Speaks-Tanner, and Jeff Stone</i></p>\n<p>********************************************************************</p>\n<p><b>You may contribute using a credit card by clicking on the “Donate” button at </b><a href=\"http://www.dignityusa.org\"><b>www.dignityusa.org</b></a><b> and selecting Dignity New York.

Our theme for Lent 2025 is hope. Van Gogh paid close attention to detail in his artwork. He had a great ability to notice beauty in the world around him and reflect that beauty on a canvas. As LGBTQIA Catholics, Van Gogh's work gives us an opportunity to reflect on hope, forgiveness, and finding beauty in darkness. Vincent Van Gogh and the Beauty of Lent is a devotional with reflections for Ash Wednesday, each Sunday in Lent, and Holy Week.</p>",

IWD isn't country, group or organization specific. It's a day of collective global activism and celebration that belongs to all those committed to forging women's equality. </p>\n<p>World-renowned feminist, journalist and activist, Gloria Steinem, reportedly once explained:<br/>\n\"The story of women's struggle for equality belongs to no single feminist nor to any one organization but to the collective efforts of all who care about human rights.\"</p>\n<p>So together, let's all help fight the good fight. All IWD activity is valid, that's what makes IWD so inclusive.

Condemning people for what they do in grief and how they tell the truth of a life is just wrong.”<br/>\nDuddy-Burke described Gentili as an individual who used her status in New York’s community to “do good for others at the margins” and that she “modeled what Christian service was about, even if she didn’t claim the title Christian.”<br/>\n“To take the step of publicly condemning the funeral just seems unwise, unchristian, and uncharitable,” she said.<br/>\nFull story can be found: <a href=\"https://gaycitynews.com/archdiocese-new-york-criticizes-cecilia-gentili-funeral-st-patricks-cathedral/\">https://gaycitynews.com/archdiocese-new-york-criticizes-cecilia-gentili…</a></p>",

As we look back over the past year, we have much to be proud of, from our 50th anniversary celebrations to our progressive, inclusive liturgies in person and online, our warm and welcoming community, and our many social and outreach activities.  We continue to be a unique community of LGBTQI+ people and allies within the Roman Catholic tradition, where we can speak our truth without fear and be our whole selves.</p>\n<p>As usual, we have a busy schedule of Pride activities planned.  We will be participating in the Queens Pride Parade on Sunday, June 4.  Our annual Pride Liturgy and reception will be held on Saturday, June 24, at 6:30 PM at St. John’s.  We are excited to share that our homilist will be Maddie Marlett, co-facilitator of the Dignity Young Adult Caucus.  On Sunday, June 25, we will take part in our annual Witness at St. Patrick’s Cathedral and then the NYC Pride March. </p>\n<p>We come to you once again, as we do every year at this time, to ask for your financial support.  The attached financial report shows our income and expenses over the first six months of the current fiscal year.  As you may know, we count heavily on our Pride Appeal to help cover the difference between our weekly collections and our annual expenses.</p>\n<p>In addition to our usual activities, this summer two of our members, Brian Frank and Catherine Buck, will be among the pilgrims representing us and all of DignityUSA at World Youth Day in Lisbon, Portugal.  The Steering Committee would like to make a significant contribution to their expenses, and your contributions will help us do that.  By being present as out LGBTQI+ people, our pilgrims will be a beacon of hope and affirmation for all the LGBTQI+ people throughout our church who cannot be visible.</p>\n<p>This year we are sending out physical Pride Appeal letters as well as email letters.  The Pride Appeal letter will also be posted on our website: <a href=\"http://www.dignityny.org\">www.dignityny.org</a>  You may respond by sending a check in the enclosed reply envelope to our mailbox (address below), by using the donate button on our website, or by online banking.</p>\n<p>You may also use the reply form to renew your annual membership, which is a joint membership in Dignity/New York and DignityUSA.  The fee is $60 per individual, or $120 per couple.  However, membership is available to all regardless of financial ability, so please let us know if you would like to be a member but need financial assistance to do so.</p>\n<p>We thank you in advance for your continuing generosity, and look forward to seeing you at our Pride activities and throughout the coming year!</p>\n<p>The Steering Committee of Dignity/New York</p>\n<p>Chris Alberti, Danny Larkin, Tom McLoughlin, James Osbourn, Lewis Speaks-Tanner, Jeff Stone, and Daniel Velásquez</p>",

Through the story told directly by its protagonist, the biopic, with a light tone and using original documentary material, reconstructs over thirty years of political history, bearing witness to a tough and gentle fight in the name of dignity and equality. This journey – also a sentimental one – touches upon the places of Grillini's life: from his birth home in the country to his university, from the headquarters of old parties that no longer exist to Parliament, as well as in the streets and squares of Gay Pride parades, from Rome to New York.</p>\n<p>The stages in Franco Grillini’s life are punctuated by struggles and victories – from the tragic AIDS years, marked by death and the stigmatizing of homosexual relations, to the first same-sex marriages, and the still-ongoing battle for stepchild adoption – but also the evolution of the approach to a topic which still today, even though it concerns millions of people, is strongly divisive if not ignored. Grillini talks about public and private aspects with serenity and humor, in a language that his Bolognese accent transforms into a musical lilt, about his firm yet serene hope for a future without lives lived in fear of social stigma, for the right to health, and the full expression of love and affection.</p>\n<p>This film collects stories of love and political battles, both inside and outside of Parliament, insuppressible driving forces for change and a zest for life.</p>",

We just concluded our 50th anniversary year with a wonderful dinner and liturgy. We couldn’t have reached this milestone without you, and we need your continued support to sustain our beautiful community and advance our mission for many more years to come.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the financial report below, we had some unusually large expenses over this past fiscal year because of our support of the DignityUSA national conference in July and our own anniversary and Pride celebrations.  Our weekly contributions do not cover the full cost of our activities, and we drew on our savings to make up the difference. We depend on the Advent Appeal to help replenish those savings.</p>\n<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to social justice, we will continue our tradition of contributing 10% of our Advent Appeal to the Trinity Place Shelter for LGBTQ+ youth on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. This excellent organization provides transitional housing and supportive services for up to 18 months for 10 young adults at a time.</p>\n<p>To help enrich our experience of Advent, we are offering to each member of our community a free copy of The Little Blue Book Advent and Christmas Seasons 2022-2023. If you are unable to pick one up at St. John’s, please email <a href=\"mailto:dignitynewyork@gmail.com\">dignitynewyork@gmail.com</a> with your address and we will mail one to you. We also invite you to participate in DignityUSA’s weekly online Advent Reflection Series, starting on November 30.

In this Pride season, we certainly have much to be proud of: 50 years of support, worship, and witness. 50 years of working for equality and inclusion for LGBTQI people in the Catholic Church and beyond. 50 years of activism within the broader LGBTQI movement, through the height of the AIDS epidemic, the fight for our civil rights, and the struggle for marriage equality.</p>\n<p>The past few years have certainly been tumultuous. During the Covid pandemic, we have innovated with online liturgies and now hybrid liturgies to serve the needs of our community. But we have lived through difficult times before, and have always emerged stronger in our faith and sense of community. Our mission remains as vital today as it was a half century ago.</p>\n<p>To mark our 50th anniversary, we are planning many special events throughout 2022, starting with a picnic after our liturgy on Pentecost Sunday, June 5th. We will be participating in the Queens Pride Parade (also Sunday, June 5th) and the Brooklyn Pride Parade (Saturday, June 11th), as well as our annual Witness at St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the NYC Pride March (Sunday, June 26th). Our annual Pride Liturgy will be held on Saturday, June 25th, at 6:30 PM at St. John’s, to be followed by a social with food and drink. We are planning a festive anniversary dinner and liturgy for October. In addition, our Membership Outreach group is planning many social activities throughout the year.</p>\n<p>We come to you once again, as we do every year at this time, to ask for your support so that we can continue with all our activities. The attached financial report shows our income and expenses over the first six months of the current fiscal year. As we returned to St. John’s in June 2021, our expenses returned to a more normal and higher level. As you know, we count heavily on our Pride Appeal to help cover the difference between our weekly collections and our annual expenses.</p>\n<p>This year we are sending out physical Pride Appeal letters as well as email letters. The Pride Appeal letter is also posted on our website: <a href=\"http://www.dignityny.org\">www.dignityny.org</a> You may respond either by sending a check in the enclosed reply envelope to our mailbox (address below), by using the donate button on our website, or by online banking.</p>\n<p>You may also use the reply form to renew your annual membership, which is a joint membership in Dignity/New York and DignityUSA. The fee is now $60 per individual, or $120 per couple. However, membership is available to all regardless of financial ability, so please let us know if you would like to be a member but need financial assistance to do so.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you at our activities as we celebrate this exciting anniversary year! </p>\n<p>The Steering Committee of Dignity/New York<br/>\nChris Alberti, Danny Larkin, Tom McLoughlin, James Osbourn, Lewis Speaks-Tanner, and Jeff Stone</p>\n<p>Dignity/New York — member chapter of DignityUSA P.O.

Easter changes each year moving to the Sunday after the \"Paschal Full Moon,\" and can fall between March 22 and April 25.</p>\n<p>In ancient times before calendars were common, most people did not know the dates for the upcoming Liturgical year. On Epiphany Sunday, the upcoming dates were \"proclaimed\" after the gospel or after communion in this way:</p>\n<p>Dear people of God, the glory of our God has shone upon us, and shall ever be manifest among us, until the day of the return of the Anointed One.</p>\n<p>Through the rhythms of times and seasons let us celebrate the mysteries of salvation.</p>\n<p>Let us recall the year's liturgical culmination, the Easter Triduum of Jesus the Christ: his last supper, his crucifixion, his burial, and his rising, Pascal Mystery celebrated between the evening of the Fourteenth day of April and the evening of the Sixteenth day of April, Easter Sunday being on the Seventeenth day of April.</p>\n<p>Each Easter -- as on each Sunday -- the Holy Church makes present the great and saving deed by which Jesus has forever conquered sin and death. From Easter then are reckoned all the days we keep holy.</p>\n<p>Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, will occur on the Second of March.</p>\n<p>The Ascension of Jesus the Christ will be commemorated on Sunday, the Twenty-Ninth of May.</p>\n<p>Pentecost, joyful conclusion of the season of Easter, will be celebrated on the Fifth day of June.</p>\n<p>Gay Pride Liturgy will be celebrated on Saturday, the Twenty-Fifth of June.</p>\n<p>Commemoration of the Stonewall Riots  will be celebrated on Sunday, the Twenty-Sixth of June. </p>\n<p>And, this year the First Sunday of Advent will be on the Twenty-Seventh  of November.</p>\n<p>Likewise the pilgrim Church proclaims the Passover of the Anointed One in the feasts of the holy Mother of God, in the feasts of the Apostles and Saints, and in the commemoration of the faithful departed.</p>\n<p>And our community will celebrate its own Anniversary on Sunday, the Twenty-Third of October for the Fiftieth time.</p>\n<p>To Jesus Christ the Anointed One, who was, who is, and who is to come, God of time and history, be endless praise, for ever and ever.<br/>\nAmen.</p>",

    "date": "",
    "body": "<p>November 28, 2021<br/>\nDear Members and Friends of Dignity/New York,</p>\n<p>With the arrival of Advent and the beginning of a new liturgical year, we naturally look back upon the past year.  It has been a time of transition for our community.  After more than fifteen months away, we cautiously returned to in-person liturgies at St. John’s in June, while also offering a Zoom option.  Although slightly different in some ways, our liturgies continue to joyfully celebrate who we are as LGBTQ+ Catholics and allies.</p>\n<p>We couldn’t have gotten through this challenging period without your generous contributions of time, talent, and treasure.  So, we come to you once again, as we do every year at this time, to ask for your continued support.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the financial report below, our expenses exceeded our income by about $400.  Notably, we received more than one third of our annual income online.  Now that we have gone back to St. John’s, most of our expenses have returned to their former levels, but our weekly collections do not fully cover our operating costs.  In fact, we depend on our annual Advent Appeal to contribute approximately $5,000 toward our yearly expenses, and we hope we are able to meet that goal this year.</p>\n<p>One of the things we pray for during Advent is the coming of justice.  In past years, as part of our commitment to social justice, our community has made financial contributions to the Trinity Place Shelter for LGBTQ+ youth on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  This year, in continuation of that tradition, we have committed to contribute 10% of our Advent Appeal to this excellent organization, which provides transitional housing and professional supportive services for up to 18 months for 10 young adults at a time.</p>\n<p>To help enrich our experience of Advent, each household in our community has been offered a free physical or electronic copy of The Little Blue Book Advent and Christmas Seasons 2021-2022.  Using this book as a resource, we will have three online meetings to reflect on how our Advent and Christmas experience is going. The dates are all on Tuesdays: November 30, December 21, and January 4 at 7:30 PM, using the regular Zoom link for our Sunday liturgy.  This can be found in the Worship Aid that can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.dignityny.org\">www.dignityny.org</a> under Liturgy toward the bottom of the homepage.</p>\n<p>As always, we look forward to seeing you every Sunday evening at 6:30 PM EST at St. John’s or online for our regular Sunday liturgies, and for our Christmas Eve liturgy on Friday, December 24, at 6:30 PM EST.  We will not have a liturgy on Christmas Day, but will resume our regular Sunday liturgies on December 26.</p>\n<p>With our best wishes and prayers for a safe and peaceful Advent and Christmas, and a Happy New Year,</p>\n<p>The Steering Committee of Dignity/New York<br/>\nChris Alberti, Danny Larkin, Tom McLoughlin, James Osbourn, Lewis Speaks-Tanner, and Jeff Stone</p>\n<p>[Click on the attached PDF file for formatted letter with financial detail]<br/>\n************************************************************************<br/>\nYou may contribute using a credit card by clicking the donation button on <a href=\"http://www.dignityny.org\">www.dignityny.org</a>  or by mailing a check to our address:</p>\n<p>Dignity/New York<br/>\nPO Box 1554, FDR Station<br/>\nNew York, NY 10150-1554</p>\n<p>This appeal will be sent by email only.

Here are some highlights:</p>\n<p>Due to the changing health situation, face coverings are once again required for ALL in the church at St. John’s.  They are optional outside, such as in the courtyard.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will conform to all regulations of St. John’s, the Episcopal Diocese, the city, state, and CDC.</p>\n<p>Advance reservations are no long required for attendance at St. John’s.  Seating remains socially distanced, six feet apart.  Capacity in the church is now approximately 60 people.  There should be ample seating for everyone who comes, in designated spots for 1 or 2 people.  You may continue to sit by yourself if you wish.</p>\n<p>Our hybrid liturgies are going well, with about 25-30 participants each week at St. John’s and a similar number on Zoom.</p>\n<p>We could use more volunteers to serve as readers, sacristans, and coordinators. Please contact Larry Caputo (Larry4Card at aol.com) or any Steering Committee member.</p>\n<p>We are planning a homecoming party at St. John’s after liturgy on September 19, in the courtyard with refreshments.</p>\n<p>We are also planning a special anniversary celebration with refreshments after our anniversary liturgy at St. John’s on October 24, also in the courtyard if weather permits.</p>\n<p>We approved a budget for fiscal year 2021-22, which runs from November 1, 2021, through October 31, 2022.  It is very similar to the budget we had before the pandemic.  We are in good financial condition, but we hope to maintain or improve weekly collections (in-person and online) and our Advent and Pride appeals.</p>\n<p>The Diversity Outreach of Dignity/New York (DODNY) has some exciting ideas for community activities starting this fall.  We will keep you posted.<br/>\nSteering Committee elections are coming up in September and you will be receiving more information soon.  Please consider whether you would be interested in serving on the committee, or if you would like to nominate someone.  At least five spots will be open.  Steering Committee meetings will continue to be held via Zoom for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>A Note about our Finances and the DignityUSA Leadership Stabilization Fund</p>\n<p>Last year, the Steering Committee received a request for support of DignityUSA’s Leadership Stabilization Fund, along with a detailed proposal and financial report.  The purpose of the fund is to ensure that DignityUSA continues to have capable and effective executive leadership for the next five years.  Other large chapters and major donors were also approached, and many have already made significant contributions.</p>\n<p>The Steering Committee believes the finances of DignityUSA are well managed and the request is a reasonable and necessary one.  Also, we firmly believe that the work of DignityUSA is vital to the success and stability of our local community.  DignityUSA, especially through our Executive Director Marianne Duddy-Burke, is our connection to other Dignity members and communities across the US, our link to other progressive Catholic organizations in the US and around the world, our respected voice in national and international media, and a source of support and resources for our local community in many different ways.</p>\n<p>After discussions stretching across several meetings, the Steering Committee voted unanimously to contribute $20,000 to the Fund over four years, in installments of $5,000 each.  Because of the generosity of our members and friends over the years, a large bequest received some years ago, and a substantial increase in the value of our investments held as a prudent reserve, the Steering Committee believes that this contribution is well within our means and will not have a negative impact on any other needs or priorities of our community.</p>\n<p>As we are all aware, the past year and a half have been extraordinary in many different ways.  As we begin to emerge into a new era, our finances will adjust to meet new needs and priorities.  We are anticipating several major events next year, including Dignity/New York’s 50th anniversary, a return to in-person Pride celebrations, and an in-person DignityUSA national conference in San Diego.</p>\n<p>We plan to support all these activities, as well as others that may emerge from discussions within our community.  One of the Steering Committee’s goals for the coming year is to develop a strategic financial plan that will allow us to maintain a prudent reserve while making the most effective use possible of our financial resources.  Stay tuned for more information in the coming months!</p>",

    "date": "",
    "body": "<p>June 8, 2021</p>\n<p>Dear Members and Friends of Dignity/New York,</p>\n<p>The members of the Steering Committee send you warm and hopeful greetings at the beginning of Pride Month 2021.  Thanks be to God and science, we are in a far different place than we were a year ago.  Fifteen months after we were forced to suspend services at St. John’s, we are now planning to return there and resume our regular Sunday liturgy schedule on June 20.  (You should have recently received a separate email about this, which is now posted on our website: <a href=\"http://www.dignityny.org\">www.dignityny.org</a>)</p>\n<p>Once again, we want to thank our Liturgy Committee for their tremendous work on our Zoom liturgies, which have sustained us through a dark time of isolation and uncertainty, and have become the “gold standard” of online liturgies.  We hope to bring some aspects of those liturgies into St. John’s, and will keep you updated.</p>\n<p>We know that for many of you, the pandemic has created great financial hardship.  Nevertheless, Dignityyou have been extremely generous with your financial support, which has enabled us to meet our ongoing fixed expenses of rent, insurance, phone, storage, and so on.  A report of our income and expenses over the past six months has been appended to this letter below.  As we return to St. John’s, our expenses will naturally return to a more normal and higher level.  As you know, we count on our Pride Appeal to help cover the difference between our weekly collections and our expenses.</p>\n<p>Because we did not meet physically to assemble a mailing, this appeal will be sent by email only.  You may contribute by using the donate button on our website (<a href=\"http://www.dignityny.org\">www.dignityny.org</a>), by online banking, or by mailing checks to our mailbox (address below).  A reply form is appended below, which you may print out if you wish and return if you mail your contribution.  However, this is not necessary.</p>\n<p>If you mail a check, please indicate on the memo line that it is a contribution to the Pride Appeal.  Please also indicate if you would like a portion of your contribution to be used to renew your annual membership, which is a joint membership in Dignity/New York and DignityUSA.  The fee is now $60 per individual, or $120 per couple.  However, we make membership available to all regardless of financial ability, so please let us know if you would like to be a member but need financial assistance to do so.</p>\n<p>As we emerge from the pandemic, we are entering a new era in our life as a spiritual community, and in our individual lives.  We know that the pandemic has been a time of loss, fear, and trauma, as well as resilience.  We know that many of us are grieving lost loved ones and lost opportunities, and are continuing to feel anxiety as we face rapidly changing realities.</p>\n<p>As we start to gather physically once again, we will draw upon the strength of our faith tradition and one another to heal and to grow, as we have always done.  Thank you for your continued support of our beloved community, and our message of equality and inclusion for LGBTQ+ people in the Catholic Church and beyond.  As we have seen from the Vatican’s recent denial of blessings to same-sex couples, and DignityUSA’s own Catholic Pride Blessing in response, we still have a lot of work to do, and a vital role to play.</p>\n<p>Blessings to you at Pride and always!</p>\n<p>The Steering Committee of Dignity/New York</p>\n<p>Chris Alberti, Larry Caputo, Andrew Jones, Danny Larkin, Tom McLoughlin, James Osbourn, Lewis Speaks-Tanner, and Jeff Stone</p>\n<p>Financial Report   (PDF attachment has the financial report and slip to enclose donation by check)<br/>\nNovember 1st 2020 - May 1st 2021</p>",

    "title": "Return to St. John's on Sunday, June 20, 2021",
    "date": "2021-06-20",
    "body": "<p>Dear Members and Friends,</p>\n<p>We have very exciting and joyous news!  After fifteen months away, we will be returning to St. John’s for in-person liturgies.  We will resume our regular weekly schedule on Sunday, June 20, at 6:30 PM.  Our Pride liturgy will be held at St. John’s on the following Sunday, June 27, at 6:30 PM.  This is a change from our past tradition of holding our Pride service on the Saturday evening of Pride weekend, which we anticipate will be for this year only.</p>\n<p>We have heard your voices in our recent online survey and the virtual town hall meeting.  A majority of our members are eager to return to in-person services, but many are also mindful of the online community that has formed during the pandemic.  We thank the Liturgy Committee for their tremendous efforts in producing our online Zoom liturgies every single week since March 15, 2020.  We are looking at ways to bring some aspects of the Zoom liturgies to St. John’s, and to allow online participants to see and hear what is happening there.  We anticipate this will be an evolving situation, and we will need a committed team of volunteers to help run the technology.</p>\n<p>We are required to follow all the safety measures that remain in place at St. John’s.  We must wear masks indoors at all times and sit in designated spots for social distancing.  The windows will be kept open as much as possible.  Capacity is currently limited to 40 people in the pews, sitting either singly or in groups of 2, so we will be asking you to reserve a spot in advance by email.</p>\n<p>There will be three options: sitting by yourself, sitting with another person of your choice, or being willing to sit with another person from the congregation in order to maximize capacity.  There is a limited overflow capacity of 8 seats in the common room.  Walk-ins will be permitted if space is available, but they will need to provide contact information in the event contact tracing is necessary.  You will receive more information about reserving seats soon.</p>\n<p>We all look forward to raising our voices in song, but for the time being we will need to keep our masks on while singing (except for the choir).  There will be some other adjustments, as well.  The sign of peace will be by wave.  (Hugs before and after liturgy are up to you, but please respect everyone’s comfort level.)</p>\n<p>Communion will be in the form of bread only, and only in the hand, given by a single presider or eucharistic minister who will visibly wash their hands before the consecration.   We will process to the altar slightly differently and stand in designated spots around the sanctuary to receive Communion.</p>\n<p>There will be hand sanitizer at the door.  Since touch has now been determined by the CDC to have a low risk of transmission, we will be using our regular hymnals and paper materials as needed.  Name tags will be offered but will be optional as always.  The collection will be taken using our regular baskets, as before.</p>\n<p>During the warm weather months, we will hold the social in the courtyard.  We do not need to wear masks there, and we can serve both food and drink outside.  If we move into the common room because of bad weather, we must continue to wear masks, and drinks only may be served. </p>\n<p>We know from our survey that we are a heavily vaccinated community, at or very close to 100%.  We know that infection rates in the city and region have fallen to very low levels.  So far, the vaccines have been shown to be extremely effective against infection and severe illness.  Given all that, plus the strong safety measures still in place at St. John’s, we are confident that the environment will be very safe for worship and socializing.   Although we do not currently plan to ask anyone for proof of vaccination, we strongly urge anyone who has not yet received a vaccine to do so, for their own protection as well as that of the entire community.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you at our Zoom liturgies on June 7 and June 13, and then in person on June 20 at St. John’s (we hope with a Zoom link to the service available also).  We will be in touch again soon about reserving seats.  Feel free to contact any member of the Steering Community if you have questions or concerns.</p>\n<p>We know that many of us are returning to St. John’s with mixed emotions, and have suffered illness, financial difficulties, and the loss of loved ones during the pandemic.  We look forward to renewing our ties in person and sustaining one another through the traditions of our faith as we celebrate, grieve, and move forward into our 49th year as a community.</p>\n<p>In Dignity,</p>\n<p>The Steering Committee of Dignity/New York</p>\n<p>Chris Alberti, Larry Caputo, Andrew Jones, Danny Larkin, Tom McLoughlin, James Osbourn, Lewis Speaks-Tanner, and Jeff Stone</p>",

Let the rain wash away the memory of the heart, and neglect. Then Oh God, let the sun come out and fill the sky with beautiful rainbows. Let the warmth of the Sun heal us wherever we are broken. Let It burn away the fog so that each of us sees each other clearly. So that we can move beyond labels, beyond accents, gender, sexual orientation, or skin color. Let the warmth and brightness of the sun melt our selfishness. So that we can share the joy and sorrow of our neighbors. And let the light of the sun be so strong that we will see all people as our neighbors. Let the Earth, nourished by rain, bring forth flowers to surround us with your beauty, and let the mountains teach our hearts to reach upward to heaven. Then, Dear God, grant us comfort, give us peace, and allow us strength to enable us to Stand up, Fight for, and be a Voice for Equality. In Jesus’ name, Amen!    </em>Offered by Rev. Debra J.
